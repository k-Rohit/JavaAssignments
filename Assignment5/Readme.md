## This project illustrates the implementation of abstract classes and interfaces

The program is splitted into multiple files containing differenet class for all the shapes

`Shapes` - Abstract Class <br>
`Volume` - Interface

### abstract public void calculateArea(); - 
This abstract method would be overridden in the other classes
for calculating the area of given shape

###  public  static void showShape(String shape);
This function prints the shape of the shape

So in every other classes these methods are overridden for the class specific implementation.
